# SocialMediaSentiment
Analysis for Week 5 Discussion
# Prepare your Dataset:
I chose a text-based dataset from Kaggle for my week 5 discussion regarding NLP workloads. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset/code)
# Key insights, patterns, or trends
The sentiment distribution as a whole was largely positive. Before 2015, negative comments were not in the sample group. However, the sample group visually doubled in 2023. Negative sentiments appear to be higher in September, and positive sentiments are higher in February. Sentiments between the three platforms are relatively equal in distribution. The most common word in the text data was new followed by life. 
# Features for Modeling:
Used TF-IDF Vectorization to distinguish words for sentiment classification. Sentiment Scores will likely need further refining but will help to determine emotional tone. Using TD-IDF will allow integration with traditional ML algorithms.
